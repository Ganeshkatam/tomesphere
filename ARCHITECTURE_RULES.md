# TomeSphere Architectural Rules & Conventions

**STATUS: ENFORCED**
This document serves as the absolute source of truth for architectural boundaries within the TomeSphere platform. Do not merge PRs that violate these rules.

## 1. Directory Strictness

- **`❌ NO NEW ROOT FOLDERS IN /app`**: The `/app` directory is exclusively for Next.js App Router routing (`page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, `route.ts`).
- **`❌ NO UI COMPONENTS IN /app`**: All business logic and UI must live inside `/modules` or `/components/ui`.
- **`✅ ALL NEW LOGIC GOES INTO /modules`**: Feature-Sliced Design is mandatory. If you build a new feature, create a new module (e.g., `/modules/planner`).

## 2. Module Ownership Contract

Every module (e.g., `/modules/books`) MUST strictly own its:

- `/actions` (Server Actions / Mutations)
- `/components` (Domain-aware UI components)
- `/services` (Business logic / Heavy compute)
- `/schemas` (Zod validation contracts)
- `/types` (TypeScript interfaces)
- `/hooks` (Client-side React hooks)
- `/pages` (Top-level view orchestration to be imported by `/app`)

## 3. Security & Type Safety

- **`❌ NO "any" TYPES`**: All data fetched from Supabase must be strictly typed using generated Database types or strict Zod schemas.
- **`✅ ALL MUTATIONS REQUIRE ZOD`**: Never trust client input. Every Server Action must validate inputs using Zod before interacting with the database.
- **`✅ NEVER LEAK RAW ERRORS`**: Catch blocks must log raw errors internally and return sanitized, generic error strings to the user to prevent PostgreSQL schema leaks.

## 4. UI Component Hierarchy

- **`/components/ui`**: Reserved strictly for highly reusable, domain-agnostic primitives (e.g., `Button`, `Modal`, `Input`).

- **`/modules/[domain]/components`**: Reserved for business-specific UI (e.g., `BookCard`, `StudyPlanWidget`).
- **`❌ NO DUPLICATE SYSTEMS`**: Do not create generic components outside of `/components/ui`.

## 5. Performance Constraints

- **`✅ ALL COLLECTION QUERIES MUST PAGINATE`**: Do not use unbounded `.select('*')` queries. Feeds, messages, and searches must enforce a `.limit()`.
- **`✅ USE GRANULAR SUSPENSE`**: Wrap heavy data-fetching components in `<Suspense>` rather than relying exclusively on global `loading.tsx` files.
